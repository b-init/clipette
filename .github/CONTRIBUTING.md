Bug fixes, feature additions, tests, documentation and more can be contributed via [issues][link_issues] and/or [pull requests][link_pulls]. All contributions are welcome.

- Make sure to test your updates prior to creating a pull request.

### Guidelines

- Separate code commits from reformatting commits.
- Follow PEP 8.
- When committing only documentation changes please include `[ci skip]` in the commit message to avoid running tests on AppVeyor.
- Include [Documentation][link_docs_md] as needed or appropriate with your bug fixes, feature additions and tests.

## Reporting Issues

When reporting issues, please include code that reproduces the issue and whenever possible, an image that demonstrates the issue. Please upload images to GitHub, not to third-party file hosting sites. If necessary, add the image to a zip or tar archive.
